# Project: Visualizing Geographic Data About Airports

In fields like meteorology and and climatology, geographic data plays a crucial role in understanding the Earth's systems. Besides its prevalence in scientific fields, geographic data powers our mapping and navigation software like Google Maps and allows us to see where our friends and family are on Facebook and Foursquare. Geographic data like latitudes and longitudes are difficult to understand using data charts and plots. To explore this kind of data, we need to learn how to visualize the data on maps.

## Context 
This project is part of Dataquest.io guided projects. Datasets were provided and we were asked to make data exploration in Jupyter Notebook. Each project were constituted of 6 to 8 steps of exploration, analysis, visualization and sometimes machine learning algorithm implementation. Additional steps were given at the end of each project to advance our exploration. The text cells between each code cells are part of the instructions that were provided. It is slightly retouched. For example, instead of 'you', it has been replace by 'we' to improve readability. 

## Install
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Basemap](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer.

## Code
All the code is in the notebook `visualizing_geo_data.ipynb`.

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory titanic_survival_exploration/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```
jupyter notebook visualizing_geo_data.ipynb
```

or
```
ipython notebook visualizing_geo_data.ipynb
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser.

## Data
The datasets are provided by [openflight](http://openflights.org/data.html).
